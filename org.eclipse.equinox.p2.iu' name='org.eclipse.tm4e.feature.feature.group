This capability is provided with the intent of allowing&#xA;such users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products. Information&#xA;about packaging Installable Software is available at&#xA;http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html (&quot;Specification&quot;).&#xA;&#xA;You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install&#xA;Installable Software.

By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and making it&#xA;available in accordance with the Specification, you further acknowledge your&#xA;agreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the&#xA;following:&#xA;&#xA;1.  A series of actions may occur (&quot;Provisioning Process&quot;) in which a user may&#xA;execute the Provisioning Technology on a machine (&quot;Target Machine&quot;) with the&#xA;intent of installing, extending or updating the functionality of an&#xA;Eclipse-based product.&#xA;2.  During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third&#xA;party Installable Software or a portion thereof to be accessed and copied to&#xA;the Target Machine.&#xA;3.  Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and&#xA;conditions that govern the use of the Installable Software (&quot;Installable&#xA;Software Agreement&quot;) and such Installable Software Agreement shall be&#xA;accessed from the Target Machine in accordance with the Specification. Such&#xA;Installable Software Agreement must inform the user of the terms and&#xA;conditions that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance&#xA;by the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable&#xA;Software Agreement. Upon such indication of agreement by the user, the&#xA;provisioning Technology will complete installation of the&#xA;Installable Software.&#xA;&#xA;Cryptography&#xA;&#xA;Content may contain encryption software.

This capability is provided with the intent of allowing&#xA;such users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products. Information&#xA;about packaging Installable Software is available at&#xA;http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html (&quot;Specification&quot;).&#xA;&#xA;You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install&#xA;Installable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling the applicable&#xA;license agreements relating to the Installable Software to be presented to, and&#xA;accepted by, the users of the Provisioning Technology in accordance with the&#xA;Specification. By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and making it&#xA;available in accordance with the Specification, you further acknowledge your&#xA;agreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the&#xA;following:&#xA;&#xA;1.  A series of actions may occur (&quot;Provisioning Process&quot;) in which a user may&#xA;execute the Provisioning Technology on a machine (&quot;Target Machine&quot;) with the&#xA;intent of installing, extending or updating the functionality of an&#xA;Eclipse-based product.&#xA;2.  During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third&#xA;party Installable Software or a portion thereof to be accessed and copied to&#xA;the Target Machine.&#xA;3.  Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and&#xA;conditions that govern the use of the Installable Software (&quot;Installable&#xA;Software Agreement&quot;) and such Installable Software Agreement shall be&#xA;accessed from the Target Machine in accordance with the Specification. Such&#xA;Installable Software Agreement must inform the user of the terms and&#xA;conditions that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance&#xA;by the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable&#xA;Software Agreement. Upon such indication of agreement by the user, the&#xA;provisioning Technology will complete installation of the&#xA;Installable Software.&#xA;&#xA;Cryptography&#xA;&#xA;Content may contain encryption software.

This capability is provided with the intent of allowing&#xA;such users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products. Information&#xA;about packaging Installable Software is available at&#xA;http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html (&quot;Specification&quot;).&#xA;&#xA;You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install&#xA;Installable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling the applicable&#xA;license agreements relating to the Installable Software to be presented to, and&#xA;accepted by, the users of the Provisioning Technology in accordance with the&#xA;Specification. By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and making it&#xA;available in accordance with the Specification, you further acknowledge your&#xA;agreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the&#xA;following:&#xA;&#xA;1.  A series of actions may occur (&quot;Provisioning Process&quot;) in which a user may&#xA;execute the Provisioning Technology on a machine (&quot;Target Machine&quot;) with the&#xA;intent of installing, extending or updating the functionality of an&#xA;Eclipse-based product.&#xA;2.  During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third&#xA;party Installable Software or a portion thereof to be accessed and copied to&#xA;the Target Machine.&#xA;3.  Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and&#xA;conditions that govern the use of the Installable Software (&quot;Installable&#xA;Software Agreement&quot;) and such Installable Software Agreement shall be&#xA;accessed from the Target Machine in accordance with the Specification. Such&#xA;Installable Software Agreement must inform the user of the terms and&#xA;conditions that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance&#xA;by the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable&#xA;Software Agreement. Upon such indication of agreement by the user, the&#xA;provisioning Technology will complete installation of the&#xA;Installable Software.&#xA;&#xA;Cryptography&#xA;&#xA;Content may contain encryption software.

This capability is provided with the intent of allowing&#xA;such users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products. Information&#xA;about packaging Installable Software is available at&#xA;http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html (&quot;Specification&quot;).&#xA;&#xA;You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install&#xA;Installable Software. You shall be responsible for enabling the applicable&#xA;license agreements relating to the Installable Software to be presented to, and&#xA;accepted by, the users of the Provisioning Technology in accordance with the&#xA;Specification. By using Provisioning Technology in such a manner and making it&#xA;available in accordance with the Specification, you further acknowledge your&#xA;agreement to, and the acquisition of all necessary rights to permit the&#xA;following:&#xA;&#xA;1.  A series of actions may occur (&quot;Provisioning Process&quot;) in which a user may&#xA;execute the Provisioning Technology on a machine (&quot;Target Machine&quot;) with the&#xA;intent of installing, extending or updating the functionality of an&#xA;Eclipse-based product.&#xA;2.  During the Provisioning Process, the Provisioning Technology may cause third&#xA;party Installable Software or a portion thereof to be accessed and copied to&#xA;the Target Machine.&#xA;3.  Pursuant to the Specification, you will provide to the user the terms and&#xA;conditions that govern the use of the Installable Software (&quot;Installable&#xA;Software Agreement&quot;) and such Installable Software Agreement shall be&#xA;accessed from the Target Machine in accordance with the Specification. Such&#xA;Installable Software Agreement must inform the user of the terms and&#xA;conditions that govern the Installable Software and must solicit acceptance&#xA;by the end user in the manner prescribed in such Installable&#xA;Software Agreement. Upon such indication of agreement by the user, the&#xA;provisioning Technology will complete installation of the&#xA;Installable Software.&#xA;&#xA;Cryptography&#xA;&#xA;Content may contain encryption software.
